--> Clearing aSet
The set is empty; capacity is 8
--> aSet isEmpty returns 
true
--> The number of elements in aSet is 
0

--> Creating set1 with default constructor
--> set1 initially empty, capacity should be 3:
The set is empty; capacity is 3

--> Adding elements to set1
--> set1 after adding elements, capacity should be 3:

--> Adding elements to set1
--> resizing this.setOfEntries from 3 to 6--> resizing this.setOfEntries from 6 to 12
